## High Level Project Goal

This code trains Machine Learning models to predict whether shots taken by the Colorado Avalanche team resulted in goals.

## Purpose and Motivation

In the sport of hockey, as with all sports nowadays, stat analytics has been highly prevalent in recent years. This is partially due to increase in technology and database capabilities for holding vast amounts of team and player data, but also it is prevalent because analysts and franchises are catching on to the many benefits that it can offer. For example, further statistical analysis on expected goals in the National Hockey League (NHL) can result in:

* Coaching and play design for their teams (taking "smarter" shots during games)
* Building more fan engagement, as fans will enjoy more commentator discussion on expected goals versus actual goals
* More media coverage options, such as adding shot statistics real-time to the streams or during replays, amplifying the experience
* Increased revenue, as sponsorship on certain statistical analysis portions during game coverage ("shot speed, brought to you by Toyota", etc.)

## Dataset Description

Money Puck's website has historical shot-related data from NHL games starting from way back in the 2007-2008 season. This data contains shots from all the NHL teams, and every single unblocked shot is recorded. There are 124 attributes for each of these shots. Here are just a few examples of these attributes:
